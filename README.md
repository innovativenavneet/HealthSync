1. Technology Stack
   Frontend (Patient and Doctor Dashboard)
   ● React: For building the user interface.
   ● Redux or Context API: For state management (if needed).
   ● Material-UI or Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern UI design.
   ● WebRTC/MediaRecorder API: For capturing audio in the browser.
   ● WebSockets: For real-time communication (e.g., between patient and doctor).
   ● React Router: For routing between different pages (patient data, history, etc.).
   Backend
   ● Node.js & Express: For handling server-side logic, APIs, and routes.
   ● MongoDB: As your database to store patient medical history, doctor notes, etc.
   ● Mongoose: For object data modeling (ODM) to interact with MongoDB.
   ● Firebase or AWS SDKs (S3): For media storage, like recorded audio files.
   ● Socket.io: To enable real-time features (e.g., live status when the patient enters a
   room).
   ● Nodemailer: For sending emails automatically with medical records to the medical
   representative.
   ● Twilio: For SMS notifications (if required).
   Speech-to-Text API
   ● Google Cloud Speech API or IBM Watson Speech to Text: To convert recorded audio
   to text.
   ● Web Speech API: For browser-based speech recognition (if server-based APIs are not
   required).
   Authentication
   ● JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication and authorization.
   ● Firebase Authentication or Passport.js: For user authentication (doctor, patient, and
   admin).
   DevOps & Hosting
   ● Heroku or DigitalOcean: For backend deployment.
   ● Netlify or Vercel: For frontend deployment.
   ● MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-hosted MongoDB database.
   ● Docker: For containerization (optional).
   Other Tools
   ● Postman: For API testing.
   ● Jest or Mocha/Chai: For testing the backend APIs.
2. Outline of the Project
   ● User Roles:
3. Doctor: Can view and update patient records, view medical history, and
   prescribe medicines.
4. Patient: Can view their medical history.
5. Medical Representative: Receives a copy of the patient’s medical data via
   email.
   ● Key Features:
6. User Authentication: Doctors, patients, and medical representatives sign in via
   JWT/Firebase.
7. Patient History Management: Doctors can update patient records and medical
   history.
8. Speech-to-Text Recorder: The recorder will turn on when the patient enters the
   room and store medical information automatically.
9. Automatic Email: After the doctor’s consultation, a report will be sent to the
   medical representative via email.
10. Flow of the Project
11. User Authentication:
    ○ A doctor or patient logs in to access their respective dashboards.
12. Patient Entry:
    ○ When the patient walks in (triggered by a specific action, like scanning a QR
    code or facial recognition), the voice recorder is automatically turned on.
    ○ Flow: WebRTC/MediaRecorder API starts recording audio > Audio is streamed >
    Speech-to-text API processes the input.
13. Doctor’s Consultation:
    ○ The doctor’s suggestions, symptoms, and prescribed medicines are entered
    automatically through the speech-to-text converter.
    ○ This data is stored in MongoDB.
    ○ Flow: Audio converted to text > Data is saved in the database (via the backend
    API).
14. Report Generation and Email Delivery:
    ○ Once the consultation is complete, the system generates a detailed report of the
    visit.
    ○ This report is automatically emailed to the medical representative at the
    pharmacy.
    ○ Flow: Final report is created > PDF/HTML format is generated > Nodemailer
    sends the email.
15. Patient and Doctor Dashboards:
    ○ The patient can access their medical history through their dashboard.
    ○ The doctor can review previous visits and update medical records.
    ○ Flow: Data is fetched from MongoDB and rendered on the front end using React.
